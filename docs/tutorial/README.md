## High-Level API

The high-level API relies internally on the low-level API, so
it is recommended to first follow the low-level API tutorials
for a better understanding of the underlying behavior.

2. [High-Level API: basic nodes](b-highlevel/02-highlevel-nodes/)
3. High-Level API: optional nodes
4. [High-Level API: dynamic nodes](b-highlevel/04-dynamic-nodes/)
5. [High-Level API: codecs](b-highlevel/05-codecs/)
5. graph building options
6. Dynamic identification and connection of nodes?

## Advanced patterns on the high-level API

7. Sharing configuration/status across all the nodes (wrappers)
